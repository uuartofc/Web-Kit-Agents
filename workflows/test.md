# /test - Test Generation and Execution

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

This command generates tests, runs existing tests, or checks test coverage.

---

## Sub-commands

```
/test                - Run all tests
/test [file/feature] - Generate tests for specific target
/test coverage       - Show test coverage report
/test watch          - Run tests in watch mode
```

---

## Behavior

### Generate Tests

When asked to test a file or feature:

1. **Analyze the code**
   - Identify functions and methods
   - Find edge cases
   - Detect dependencies to mock

2. **Generate test cases**
   - Happy path tests
   - Error cases
   - Edge cases
  - Security negatives: unauthenticated, wrong role, cross-tenant, malformed, replay, rate-limit, and data-leak cases when applicable
   - Integration tests (if needed)

3. **Write tests**
   - Use project's test framework (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
   - Follow existing test patterns
   - Mock external dependencies

---

## Output Format

### For Test Generation

```markdown
## 🧪 Tests: [Target]

### Test Plan
| Test Case | Type | Coverage |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Should create user | Unit | Happy path |
| Should reject invalid email | Unit | Validation |
| Should handle db error | Unit | Error case |

### Generated Tests

`tests/[file].test.ts`

[Code block with tests]

---

Run with: `npm test`
```

### For Test Execution

```
🧪 Running tests...

✅ auth.test.ts (5 passed)
✅ user.test.ts (8 passed)
❌ order.test.ts (2 passed, 1 failed)

Failed:
  ✗ should calculate total with discount
    Expected: 90
    Received: 100

Total: 15 tests (14 passed, 1 failed)
```

### Execution Contract

1. Detect the project's actual test command before inventing one.
2. Run focused tests for changed behavior first, then the broader suite.
3. Treat no-test or skipped-test results as a coverage gap, not a pass for security-sensitive changes.
4. Preserve failure output, environment, fixture version, and reproduction command.
5. Never weaken assertions, delete failing tests, or increase retries to hide a regression.

For security or data-changing features, require at least one negative test proving unauthorized input does not mutate state.

## Examples

```
/test src/services/auth.service.ts
/test user registration flow
/test coverage
/test fix failed tests
```

## Test Patterns

### Unit Test Structure

```typescript
describe('AuthService', () => {
  describe('login', () => {
    it('should return token for valid credentials', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const credentials = { email: 'test@test.com', password: 'pass123' };
      
      // Act
      const result = await authService.login(credentials);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.token).toBeDefined();
    });

    it('should throw for invalid password', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const credentials = { email: 'test@test.com', password: 'wrong' };
      
      // Act & Assert
      await expect(authService.login(credentials)).rejects.toThrow('Invalid credentials');
    });
  });
});
```

## Key Principles

- **Test behavior not implementation**
- **One assertion per test** (when practical)
- **Descriptive test names**
- **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**
- **Mock external dependencies**
