# Testing Patterns

> Principles for reliable test suites.

---

## 1. Testing Pyramid

```
        /\          E2E (Few)
       /  \         Critical flows
      /----\
     /      \       Integration (Some)
    /--------\      API, DB queries
   /          \
  /------------\    Unit (Many)
                    Functions, classes
```

---

## 2. AAA Pattern

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Arrange** | Set up test data |
| **Act** | Execute code under test |
| **Assert** | Verify outcome |

---

## 3. Test Type Selection

### When to Use Each

| Type | Best For | Speed |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Unit** | Pure functions, logic | Fast (<50ms) |
| **Integration** | API, DB, services | Medium |
| **E2E** | Critical user flows | Slow |

---

## 4. Unit Test Principles

### Good Unit Tests

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Fast | < 100ms each |
| Isolated | No external deps |
| Repeatable | Same result always |
| Self-checking | No manual verification |
| Timely | Written with code |

### What to Unit Test

| Test | Don't Test |
|------|------------|
| Business logic | Framework code |
| Edge cases | Third-party libs |
| Error handling | Simple getters |

---

## 5. Integration Test Principles

### What to Test

| Area | Focus |
|------|-------|
| API endpoints | Request/response |
| Database | Queries, transactions |
| External services | Contracts |

### Setup/Teardown

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Before All | Connect resources |
| Before Each | Reset state |
| After Each | Clean up |
| After All | Disconnect |

---

## 6. Mocking Principles

### When to Mock

| Mock | Don't Mock |
|------|------------|
| External APIs | The code under test |
| Database (unit) | Simple dependencies |
| Time/random | Pure functions |
| Network | In-memory stores |

### Mock Types

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| Stub | Return fixed values |
| Spy | Track calls |
| Mock | Set expectations |
| Fake | Simplified implementation |

---

## 7. Test Organization

### Naming

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Should behavior | "should return error when..." |
| When condition | "when user not found..." |
| Given-when-then | "given X, when Y, then Z" |

### Grouping

| Level | Use |
|-------|-----|
| describe | Group related tests |
| it/test | Individual case |
| beforeEach | Common setup |

---

## 8. Test Data

### Strategies

| Approach | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Factories | Generate test data |
| Fixtures | Predefined datasets |
| Builders | Fluent object creation |

### Principles

- Use realistic data
- Randomize non-essential values (faker)
- Share common fixtures
- Keep data minimal

---

## 9. Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| One assert per test | Clear failure reason |
| Independent tests | No order dependency |
| Fast tests | Run frequently |
| Descriptive names | Self-documenting |
| Clean up | Avoid side effects |

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Test implementation | Test behavior |
| Duplicate test code | Use factories |
| Complex test setup | Simplify or split |
| Ignore flaky tests | Fix root cause |
| Skip cleanup | Reset state |

---

> **Remember:** Tests are documentation. If someone can't understand what the code does from the tests, rewrite them.

---

## 11. Security Regression Testing

Security behavior belongs in the normal test suite. For every security-sensitive feature, keep these layers:

| Layer | Required evidence |
|-------|-------------------|
| Unit | Validation, normalization, policy decisions, and fail-closed branches |
| Integration | Real authorization boundary, persistence, transactions, and token/session behavior |
| E2E/API | Unauthenticated, wrong-role, cross-tenant, replay, rate-limit, and malformed-input cases |
| Static | Secrets, dangerous sinks, dependency integrity, and security configuration |

Use a behavior matrix for each endpoint or command:

`actor x resource owner x action x input state x expected status`

At minimum, assert that unauthorized requests do not mutate state, do not leak whether a resource exists when that is sensitive, and do not expose stack traces or credentials. Add the regression test before or alongside the fix; a green happy-path test alone is not security coverage.

### Quality Gates

- Tests are isolated and can run in a clean environment.
- Security tests use deterministic fixtures and synthetic secrets.
- Failures include the request, actor/role, expected result, and observed result.
- Flaky security tests are fixed or quarantined with an owner and expiry date.
- Coverage percentages are secondary to coverage of authorization and abuse cases.
